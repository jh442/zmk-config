# Building a 65 (actually more like 60ish) Mechanical Keyboard
I wanted to do a small crash course in learning how to build my own mechnical keyboard. With the help from co-workers, youtube, google, and discord
I was able to get a "first iteration" worker.  I'm actually using my first keyboard to type this right now! 

With that being said, I wanted to go back and add this readme to help share some of the documentation and surprises I encountered to maybe help those that 
want to do a similar project.
